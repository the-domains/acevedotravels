Proof that we are actually on vacation TOGETHER, since most shots only have one of us at a time! Thankfully Peter knew how to operate a "real" camera.

And now, the start of our walking tour inside the city of Dubrovnik.

Typical cop. Always where you don't want him to be.

The main strip or as the locals call it the "Stradun".

The Bell tower dates from the 14th century. Its majectic presence towers over the monastery courtyard. And there's THAT guy again. :-)

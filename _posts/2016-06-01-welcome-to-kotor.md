Pyramid of shame. Small time criminals would be tied to this so the towns folk would see them and shame them for the crime they committed.

This was the town pump. A place to get water and gossip.

I wish Felicity and Skylar were here. I think they'd enjoy a museum dedicated to their species.

Lunch. Yes, I ate the whole thing. It was good. Seattle Sutton will be there when I get home.

View from our lady of the rocks. A painting of the Virgin Mary was found on a rock in the middle of the sea and it was taken as a sign that a church should be built here. It took 100 years for the sailors to bring enough rocks to create the island and another hundred to build the church (not pictured).

This is from inside the church. not sure why everyone else was taking pictures of this plant in the window. Do you see anything special about this composition?

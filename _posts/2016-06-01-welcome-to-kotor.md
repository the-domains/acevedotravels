Pyramid of shame. Small time criminals would be tied to this so the towns folk would see them and shame them for committing the crime.

This was the town pump. place to get water and gossip.

I wish Felicity and Skylar were here. I think they'd enjoy a museum dedicated to cats.

This is what happens when you don't pay attention, someone sneaks a photo of you.

View from our lady of the rocks. A painting of the Virgin Mary was found on a rock in the middle of the sea and it was taken as a sign that a church should be built here. It took 100 years for the sailors to bring enough rocks to create the island and another hundred to build the church (not pictured).

This is from inside the church. not sure why everyone else was taking pictures of this plant in the window. Do you see anything special about this composition?
